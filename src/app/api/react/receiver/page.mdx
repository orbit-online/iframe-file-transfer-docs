# React receiver API

The react API is mostly reduced to a single hook, where the only that is needed to be passed to the hook is `submitHandler` and an `errorHandler`. {{ className: 'lead' }}

## Responsibility

As an implementor of a receiver you are responsible for providing a form submit handler that uploads the file along with form- and metadata to a webservice, and return a resolved promised upon success or rejected promise upon error.

Files are transfered to the receiver along with an unique id, that is important in order to be able to update the file in Orbit afterwards via the Orbit Import Framework.

## Minimum working application

Will take a look at this bare minimum example below, and explain the API in terms of this simplified usage.

```tsx
import { useOrbitIframeFileTransferReceiver } from '@orbit-online/iframe-file-transfer/react/receiver.js';

async function onOrbitFileReceiverFormSubmit(
	url: string,
	method: string,
	formData: FormData,
	orbitEntityData: Record<string, any>,
): Promise<unknown> {
	const request = new Request(url, {
		body: formData,
		method: method,
	});

	const response = await fetch(request);
	if (!response.ok) {
		throw new Error(
			'Upload was unsuccesful, please contact external system administrator at support@external.system with details on how to reproduce this error.',
		);
	}
}

const App = () => {
	const receiver = useOrbitIframeFileTransferReceiver(
		onOrbitFileReceiverFormSubmit,
	);

	const errorContainer =
		receiver.error == null ? null : <div>{receiver.error.message}</div>;
	return (
		<form
			action="/upload"
			encType="multipart/form-data"
			method="post"
			onSubmit={receiver.onSubmit}
			ref={receiver.formRef}
		>
			{errorContainer}
			<input
				type="hidden"
				name="orbitFileId"
				ref={receiver.fileIdInputRef}
				value={receiver.orbitFileId}
				readOnly
				required
			/>
			<input
				type="text"
				name="file"
				ref={receiver.fileInputRef}
				value={receiver.file?.name}
				disabled
				required
			/>
			<input type="button" value="Cancel" onClick={receiver.onCancel} />
			<input type="submit" value="Upload" />
		</form>
	);
};
```

### `submitHandler` {{ tag: 'INPUT', label: 'SubmitHandler' }}

The submit handler will be called when all input fields are validated, such as input fields are declared `required` should have a value
and date inputs should be valid and so on. The `submitHandler` is responsible for make the HTTP request containing the file and all the required meta data to the external system.
It should return a `Promise` that resolves once the request is successful, and the library will take care of contacting the sender, that the file transmission and form submission was successful.
The `Promise` should reject if the form submission requests fails, and the library will send a copy of the error to the sender, to notify Orbit that the file transfer and form submission was unsuccessful.

```tsx
function submitHandler(
	url: string,
	method: string,
	formData: FormData,
	orbitEntityData: Record<string, any>,
): Promise<unknown> {
	const request = new Request(url, {
		body: formData,
		method: method,
	});

	const response = await fetch(request);
	if (!response.ok) {
		throw new Error(
			'Upload was unsuccesful, please contact external system administrator at support@external.system with details on how to reproduce this error.',
		);
	}
}

function App() {
	const receiver = useOrbitIframeFileTransferReceiver(submitHandler);
	return (
		<form ... onSubmit={receiver.onSubmit} ref={receiver.formRef}>
			...
		</form>
	);
}
```

### `formRef` {{ tag: 'OUTPUT', label: 'React.RefObject<HTMLFormElement>' }}

It should be passed to the `ref` prop of the form element, in order for the receiver logic
to set meta data on the form element that will be used upon submission by the `submitHandler`.

```tsx
const { formRef, ... } = useOrbitIframeFileTransferReceiver(...);

return (
	<form action="/upload" encType="multipart/form-data" method="post" ref={formRef}>
		...
	</form>
);
```

### `onSubmit` {{ tag: 'OUTPUT', label: 'React.FormEventHandler<HTMLFormElement>' }}

This handler must be passed to the `onSubmit` prop of the form element, this will intercept the
form submission when the form is validated, and assemble and patch up the form data, before handing of the
submission to the `submitHandler` that was passed as input to the hook.

```tsx
const { onSubmit, ... } = useOrbitIframeFileTransferReceiver(...);

return (
	<form action="/upload" encType="multipart/form-data" method="post" onSubmit={onSubmit}>
		...
	</form>
);
```

### `error` {{ tag: 'OUTPUT', label: 'Error | null' }}

Error object has a value when an error occurs with file transfer or if the `submitHandler` fails.

```tsx
const { error } = useOrbitIframeFileTransferReceiver(
	onOrbitFileReceiverFormSubmit,
);

const errorContainer = error == null ? null : <div>{error.message}</div>;

return (
	<div>
		{errorContainer}
		<form></form>
	</div>
);
```

### `file` {{ tag: 'OUTPUT', label: 'File | null' }}

A browser/DOM [File](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/File) object, representing the file transfered from the sender.
The object becomes available when the transfer from the sender is completed.

### `fileInputRef` {{ tag: 'OUTPUT', label: 'React.RefObject<HTMLInputElement>' }}

The id of the file from Orbit, that should be used by the external system to update the file in Orbit after processing it via the Orbit importer.

```tsx
const { orbitFileId, ... } = useOrbitIframeFileTransferReceiver(...);

return (
    <form>
        <input type="hidden" name="orbitFileId" required />
    </form>
);
```

### `imageSrc` {{ tag: 'OUTPUT', label: 'string | undefined' }}

Image src useful for preview of image, will have a value when `status` is `complete` and the file that is an image supported by the browser.

```tsx
const { imageSrc, ... } = useOrbitIframeFileTransferReceiver(...);
return (
    <img src={imageSrc} />
);
```

### `onCancel` {{ tag: 'OUTPUT', label: 'React.MouseEventHandler<HTMLInputElement>' }}

The cancel handler that tells the host (sender), that the operation has been cancelled by the user.

```tsx
const { onCancel, ... } useOrbitIframeFileTransferReceiver(...);
return (
	<form>
		<input type="button" value="Cancel" onClick={onCancel} />
	</form>
);
```

### `orbitEntityData` {{ tag: 'OUTPUT', label: 'Record<string, any>' }}

Meta about the, entity and the user that uploaded the file, sent from Orbit a long with the file. The `orbitEntityData` is available when `state` is `transfering` or `complete`.

If the users should not be able to edit the values, you could use the `readOnly` property, beware values from `disabled` input elements will not be present in `formData` upon submission.

Input elements with `type=hidden` can also be used, if it doesn't matter if the users are able to see the values.

```tsx
const { orbitEntityData, ... } = useOrbitIframeFileTransferReceiver(...);
return (
	<form>
		<input type="text" readOnly name="projectName" value={orbitEntityData.projectName} />
	</form>
);
```

### `orbitFileId` {{ tag: 'OUTPUT', label: 'string | undefined' }}

The id of the file from Orbit, that should be used by the external system to update the file in Orbit after processing it via the Orbit importer.

The value in the `[name]` attribute controls the field name in the form submission to the external system.

```tsx
const { orbitFileId, ... } = useOrbitIframeFileTransferReceiver(...);

return (
	<form>
		<input type="hidden" name="orbitFileId" value={orbitFileId} readOnly required />
	</form>
);
```

### `progress` {{ tag: 'OUTPUT', label: 'number | undefined' }}

The file transfer progress percentage between the sender and the receiver (iframe).

```tsx
const { progress, ... } = useOrbitIframeFileTransferReceiver(...);
return (
	<progress ref={progress} value={progress} max="100" />
);
```

### `setError` {{ tag: 'OUTPUT', label: 'SetErrorFn' }}

`setError` can be used to set custom errors and make them available in the error property, and change the [`status`](#status) to `error`.

### `status` {{ tag: 'OUTPUT', label: 'initial | transfering | complete | error' }}

Current status of the transmission from the sender to the receiver.

Possible values are `initial`, `transfering`, `complete` and `error`.

-   When `status` is `initial`, [`file`](#file), [`error`](#error), [`orbitFileId`](#orbit-file-id) and [`progress`](#progress) are all `null` and has no value.
-   When `status` is `error`, the [`error`](#error) property of the hook has a value.
-   When `status` is `transfering`, the [`orbitFileId`](#orbit-file-id), [`progress`](#progress) has values.
-   When `status` is `complete`, the [`file`](#file) property has a value, [`imageSrc`](#image-src) has a value if the file is an image supported by the browser.

[`file`](#file) contains a browser/DOM [File](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/File) when the transfer from the sender (host/Orbit web client) is complete.
