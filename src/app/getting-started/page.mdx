# Getting started

This guide will get you all set up and ready to use the Orbit Iframe File Transfer library. The library covers both the sender and receiver part. We'll cover how to get started using the receiver API as the sender part is usually done/implemented by the Orbit web client, and mostly doens't concern 3rd party implementers. We'll look at how you can get started using the vanilla JS variant of the API which is based on declarative HTML data-attributes, which is simlified and bit limited in control, but is simple to get started with. We also have an example of how to use it in context of React, and it is also possible to have full control, but that require a bit more boilerplate setup.

<Note>
	Before you can get started, you need to make sure to that the server serving
	the iframe allows cross-site requests, if you don't do this the browser
	won't load the iframe. See [Cross-Origin Resource Sharing
	(CORS)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS) for more
	information.

## Playground

You can use the online sender playground when you want to simulate an Orbit sender integration. Or you can host your own by cloing the github repository.

<CodeGroup>

```bash {{ title: 'git', language: 'bash' }}
# Clone the repository using git.
git clone https://github.com/orbit-online/iframe-file-transfer
```

```bash {{ title: 'GitHub CLI', language: 'bash' }}
# Clone the repository using the GitHub CLI.
gh repo clone orbit-online/iframe-file-transfer
```

</CodeGroup>

<div className="not-prose">
	<Button
		href="https://orbit-online.github.io/iframe-file-transfer/playground.html"
		variant="text"
		arrow="right"
	>
		<>Check out the online playground</>
	</Button>
</div>

## Making your first reciever

You can start out small with just plain html file and the library hosted on a [CDN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_delivery_network) like [unpkg.com](https://unpkg.com/@orbit-online/iframe-file-transfer/),
this is great for getting started.

<CodeGroup label="Using unpkg as CDN from the HTML source file.">

{/* prettier-ignore */}
```html {{ title: 'iframe.html', language: 'html' }}
<!doctype html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
	<script type="module" src="https://unpkg.com/@orbit-online/iframe-file-transfer@latest/vanilla/receiver.js"></script>
	<script type="module">
		globalThis.onSubmit = async function onSubmit(url, method, formData, orbitEntityData) {
			// submit logic goes here.
		}
	</script>
</head>
<body>
	<form enctype="multipart/form-data" action="/upload" method="post" data-orbit-file-receiver="onSubmit">
		<div data-orbit-file-receiver-error-container></div>
		<input type="hidden" name="orbitFileId" data-orbit-file-receiver-file-id required />
		<input name="file" type="file" data-orbit-file-receiver-input />
		<input type="submit" value="Upload" />
	</form>
</body>
```

```bash {{ title: 'Serve', language: 'shell' }}
npx serve
```

</CodeGroup>

You should be able to type in `http://localhost:3000/iframe.html` in the [playground](https://orbit-online.github.io/iframe-file-transfer/playground.html?iframeUrl=http://localhost:3000/iframe.html) and start testing.

However we'll recommend either downloading the needed library files you need and ship them bundled, or using a package manager like [npm](https://npmjs.com) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com) to manage it as a dependency.

<CodeGroup tag="INSTALL" label="dependency">

```bash {{ title: 'npm', language: 'shell' }}
npm install --save @orbit-online/iframe-file-transfer
```

```bash {{ title: 'yarn', language: 'shell '}}
yarn add @orbit-online/iframe-file-transfer
```

## What's next?

Great, you're have now implemented your first receiver, and tried in the playground.
