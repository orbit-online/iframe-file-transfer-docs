# Iframe file transfer SDKs

The recommended way to interact with the Orbit iframe file transfer API is by using one of our official SDKs. Today, we offer fine-tuned Vanilla JS and React libraries to make your life easier and give you the best experience when consuming the API. {{ className: 'lead' }}
