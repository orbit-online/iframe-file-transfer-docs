# Introduction

This library is typically used for transfering files, users has provided via input fields in the Orbit web client, to iframes hosted by 3rd parties. {{ className: 'lead' }}

<div className="not-prose mb-16 mt-6 flex gap-3">
	<Button href="/getting-started" arrow="right">
		<>Getting started</>
	</Button>
	<Button href="/sdks" variant="outline">
		<>Libraries</>
	</Button>
</div>

## How does it work {{ anchor: false }}

Browsers doesn't simply allow moving the protected File objects between browser contexts. It seems that ServiceWorkers support this to some extent, but it is not supported in iframes. {{ className: 'lead' }}

This library chunks the file and serializes the content of the protected File objects (sender) that originates from `<input type="file" />` input elements, and transfer the chunks to the iframe (receiver) for deserialization and re-assembly.

Though it is not possible to make the re-assembled file appear to the BrowserContext (iframe) as a trusted File, this library facilitates orchestration for mimicking the browsers behavior in a way that it feels close (enough).
